# Hello Swift!
My first time writing code in swift.

My swift:

    % swift --version
    Apple Swift version 4.0.3 (swiftlang-900.0.74.1 clang-900.0.39.2)
    Target: x86_64-apple-macosx10.9

## Tutorial
Initialize new swift package:

    swift package init --type executable

To build the package:

    swift build

To run the test:

    swift test

To run the executable:

    swift run Hello

There is a blog about using third-party
module [here](https://evgenii.com/blog/distributing-your-library-with-swift-package-manager/).

The documentation about Swift package is available [here](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager/tree/master/Documentation).
